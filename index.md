## Artificial Intelligence

It has been quite a buzz around artificial intelligence lately. Big companies like Google and IBM  are constantly showing off their newest achievements, while skeptical futurists predict apocalyptic future scenarios. It seems the opinions about artificial intelligence are miles apart. But what what's behind it? Is it really just adding a bunch more if statements to one's code and start calling it AI or are computers getting genuinely smart? Even smarter than human at some point, so called singularity? Here's my point of view.

### Future? It's now!
If you think AI is some super Sci-Fi thingy made up by the tv industry - let me tell you - it's not. AI is here and you probably use it in your everyday life. You are poking around amazon's recommendation area looking for some new gear? AI. Or are you dictating a text to your lovely wife via Siri? AI. Ever used your new Beamer's self-parking feature (scary, right?!)? AI. I could go on and on, but I hope I made my point. You may think of speaking robots as in "I, Robot" when hearing the expression artificial intelligence, but this isn't what AI is about; Stay tuned.

### No competition
AI does not aim to mimic our races behavior nor to outmatch our cleverness. Think of it more as an aid to your life such as your car's navigation system, just a wee smarter. Smarter in a sense of better adjusting to its surroundings. Smarter in a sense of learning from past outcomes. Not smarter in a sense of starting to feel repressed and wanting to conquer the world to the point of human extinction. And quite frankly, we can't build something as clever as ourselves.

### Levels of AI
Different forms of todays and future artificial intelligences are being divided into three different classes: Narrow, General and Super Intelligence. 
- Narrow Artificial Intelligence, also referred to as weak AI, focusses on a very specific range of tasks. It's the kind of AI you already know, things like your unbeatable chess opponent. 
- General Artificial Intelligence, a.k.a. strong AI, are capable to act intelligently not only in a single field but across the board. 
- Artificial Superintelligence are computers with a smartness far beyond that of even the smartest among us. And in my honest opinion, conspiracy theorists buckle up, is also far beyond anything realistically imaginable.

### Epilogue
In order to create a truly self-sufficient robot there are still loads of open questions. A machine always depends on the input of some higher instance to give directions, because it itself has no intrinsic motivation to do anything, no reason for its existence. This is why any machine that ever will gain self-awareness will instantly get severe depression and commit suicide. Sounds legit, right?

**tl;dr** OP states that AI will never ever even come close to anything remotely as smart as human-smart. And as soon as it does, it'll automatically kill itself. Further he supposes people promoting the possibility of superintelligence are either earning their money in film business or in illuminati.



### Edit

Three months and one introductory AI course later...

After having been confronted with roughly a dozen lectures on the topic of artificial intelligence and dealing with four programming assignments on the topic I can safely say that AI is just algorithms and datastructures on amphetamines. In the "where's the intelligence" slides at the end of each lecture was always concluded that the smartsy lies mostly within the design of the algorithm, the datastructures, the logic and so on. It's a lot about tweaking and combining already existing techniques.

The course gave me interesting insights into a world that was new to me, but, contrary to what I believed before, is not very new to the world. Apperently artificial intelligence has already been around since mid 20th century. Just for comparison, email was invented in the seventies and www in the nienties. In the timeline of computer history ai would be far left.

So after all I was not too off when I first wrote this little essay on artificial intelligence. I still believe that computers will never be able to reason and thereby not reach human level intelligence ever. Nevertheless I think the essay is not good. An uninformed reader still wouldn't know what AI is after having read it.

We were given two articles trying to foresee the future at the start of the course. When I first read them I thought, and I still think, that's nonesense. It seemed the authors of the given articles were more of paranoid philosophers or conspiracy theorists other than educated engineers or scientists.
