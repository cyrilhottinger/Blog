## Artificial Intelligence

It has been quite a buzz around artificial intelligence lately. Big companies like Google and IBM  are constantly showing off their newest achievments, while sceptical futurist predict an apocaliptic futurity. It seems the opinions about artificial intelligence are miles apart. But what what's behind it? Is it really just adding a bunch more if statements to ones code and start calling it AI or are computers getting genuinly smart? Even smarter than human at some point, so called singularity? Here's my point of view.

### Future? It's now!
If you think AI is some super SciFi thingy made up by the tv industry - let me tell you - it's not. AI is here and you probably use it in your everyday life. You are poking around amazons recommendation area looking for some new gear? AI. Or are you dictating a text to your lovely wife via Siri? AI. Ever used your new Beamer's selfparking feature (scary, right?!)? AI. I could go on and on, but I hope I made my point. You may think of speaking robots as in "I, Robot" when hearing the expression artificial intelligence, but this isn't what's AI about; Stay tuned.

### No competition
AI does not aim to mimick our races behavior nor to outmatch our cleverness. Think of it more as an aid to your life such as your car's navigation system, just a wee smarter. Smarter in a sense of better adjusting to it's surroundings. Smarter in a sense of learning from past outcomes. Not smarter in a sense of starting to feel repressed and wanting to conquer the world to the point of human extinction. And quite frankly, we can't build something as clever than ourselves.

### Levels of AI
Different forms of todays and future artificial intelligences are being divided into three different classes: Narrow, General and Super Intelligence. 
- Narrow Artificial Intelligence, also refered to as weak AI, focusses on a very specific range of tasks. It's the kind of AI you already know, things like your unbeatable chess oponent. 
- General Artificial Intelligence, a.k.a. strong AI, are capable to act intelligently not only in a single field but across the board. 
- Artificial Superintelligence are computers with a smartness far beyond that of even the smartest among us. And, conspiricy theorists buckle up, in my honest opionion, is also far beyond anything realistically imaginable.
